## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**enable** | **Boolean** |  | [optional] 
**model** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**models** | [**[AiModelEntry]**](AiModelEntry.md) | Models holds every configured model, in whatever order and with whatever Default flag was stored - it is NOT canonicalized on write, so nothing may assume the Default sits at index 0. Empty on configs written before multi-model support. Never read it directly: use EffectiveModels for the list as stored (which also handles the legacy case), or PolicyModels for exactly one Default in row 1 followed by the Quorum models. | [optional] 
**targetId** | **Number** |  | [optional] 
**targetName** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**version** | **Number** | Version is an optimistic-concurrency token, bumped by gator on every accepted write.  Every mutation of this part is a read-modify-write across the network (the gateway reads the whole part, edits one entry, writes it back), and the write replaces the part wholesale. Without a token, two admins adding a quorum model at the same time silently lose one of the two - which, since the list must always carry exactly one Default, can also change which model serves every other AI feature.  Zero means \&quot;unversioned\&quot;: a client that predates this field, whose write gator accepts rather than rejecting outright. See updateGatewayAiInsightsConfig. | [optional]
